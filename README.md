### Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Welsh and I'm from the east coast of the United States. I'm currently studying Software Engineering & Security but have found myself being more drawn towards my Web Development class on Udemy.

Even though I just started learning Web Development, the process has been exciting. I'm looking forward to learning more as my journey continues and will update my README throughout the process.

Future Roles: Web Developer, Full-stack Development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on gaining skills in Web Development so that I can make a career change into something I'm passionate about.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development on Udemy. So far, I'm just starting out and working with HTML & CSS. Soon onto Flexbox, Bootstrap, and then into JS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Web Development projects as I gain more knowledge on the topic.
